这个项目是由一个14岁（在发起时）的孩子发起的。希望成年人也能为我们提供帮助，感谢~

意在让所有人都能充分利用系统命令，同时也能自己制作自动化脚本，节省大量时间。这是一个系统指令的图形化界面

src是存放源代码。

lib是存放已经打包好的包。

感谢所有为此项目提供帮助的人。

项目正在开发中，使用指南还得再等会。

The project was started by a 14-year-old (at the time of the launch).Hope adults can also help us, thanks ~

The idea is to allow everyone to take full advantage of system commands while also creating their own automated scripts, which can save a lot of time.This is a graphical interface for system instructions

SRC is the source code

A lib is a holds a package that is already packaged

Thank you to all who helped with this project.

The project is under development, the guide will have to wait.
